### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I'm Alp Cetinkus.
 
 As a recent graduate from Akdeniz University's MIS program, I am excited to begin my career as an Android developer. I am skilled in building user interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing, and I am always seeking to improve my abilities in mobile development. During my studies, I took the opportunity to learn Kotlin, a programming language that has helped me to become proficient in creating mobile applications.
